resourceAllocator
=================

A simple java application to refresh my java, it is a resource allocator that will allocate resources to costumers based on revenue.

It can take 3 parameters (1 required and 2 optionals)

Required parameter INPUT FILE :

32356000
Acme,2000000,200
Lorem,3500000,400
Ipsum,2300000,210
Dolor,8000000,730
SIT,10000000,1000
Amet,1500000,160
Mauris,1000000,100

Optional parameter : number of resources to allocate

Optional parameter : inventory id to assign resources to a specic subset of costumers


Output :

<customer>,<number of campaigns to sell>,<total impressions for customer>,<total
revenue for customer>
...
<total number of impressions>,<total revenue>

I am adding this to github to save it but this "program" could not be simpler and I am not
planning to continue working on it, it is just a toy example.
